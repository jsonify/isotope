## Context Window Strategy

### Micro-Session Approach

For each handoff point, break the work into multiple focused Roo-Code context windows:

1. **Planning Session**:

   - Review relevant handoffs and milestones
   - Break down the feature into micro-tasks
   - Plan your approach and identify potential challenges

2. **Implementation Micro-Sessions**:

   - Create a separate context window for each logical component
   - Focus on 1-3 related tasks per session
   - Create a micro-handoff at the end of each session
   - Typical session groups:
     - Data model / interface design
     - Core logic implementation
     - UI component development
     - Testing and validation

3. **Integration Session**:
   - Create a final context window to pull everything together
   - Verify all components work as expected
   - Resolve any integration issues
   - Create the formal handoff document

### Micro-Handoff Format

At the end of each micro-session, document:

- Tasks completed
- Key decisions made
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Next steps
- Code snippets worth preserving

## Development Best Practices

1. Focus on one task at a time - Complete it fully before moving on
2. Keep the project memory updated with new decisions or changes
3. Commit regularly after completing each task or subtask
4. Test continuously - Write tests before implementation when possible
5. Check progress weekly against the plan and adjust if needed
6. Build vertically - Get one feature working completely rather than doing partial work on multiple features
7. Reset context windows strategically - Don't try to fit too much in one session

## Handoff Guidelines

### When creating handoff documents:

1. Reference and incorporate relevant micro-handoffs
2. Include all completed tasks since last handoff
3. Document technical challenges and their solutions
4. Note any deviations from the original plan
5. Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful
6. List any outstanding issues or known limitations
7. Document test coverage and results
8. Provide context for the next developer (even if it's yourself)

## Milestone Guidelines

### When creating milestone documents:

1. Consolidate insights from 3-5 handoffs
2. Provide high-level overview of the completed phase
3. Document architectural decisions and their rationale
4. Include lessons learned and best practices
5. Identify patterns and optimization opportunities
6. Create summary of current project state
7. Outline priorities for the next phase
