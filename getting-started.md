# Getting Started With Isotope

This guide will help you set up and start building the Isotope educational game using the files and components we've created. Let's break this down into clear steps to make it easy to get started.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1. Initialize the Project

First, let's set up the basic project structure:

```bash
# Create a new directory for the project
mkdir isotope
cd isotope

# Copy the project-setup.sh script
# (Copy the content from the Project Setup Script artifact)
nano project-setup.sh

# Make the script executable
chmod +x project-setup.sh

# Run the setup script
./project-setup.sh
```

The setup script will create a new React project with TypeScript, install all required dependencies, and set up the proper file structure.

### 2. Copy Core Domain Models

Create the base domain models that define our game's data structures:

```bash
# Create directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p src/domains/shared/models

# Create the domain-models.ts file
# (Copy the content from the Core Domain Models artifact)
nano src/domains/shared/models/domain-models.ts
```

### 3. Create Game Constants

Set up the game constants with element data and progression thresholds:

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p src/domains/shared/constants

# Create the game-constants.ts file
# (Copy the content from the Game Constants artifact)
nano src/domains/shared/constants/game-constants.ts
```

## Implementing Core Services

### 4. Build the Progression Service

This is the core service that handles player advancement:

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p src/domains/player/services

# Create the progression service
# (Copy the content from the Progression Service Implementation artifact)
nano src/domains/player/services/ProgressionService.ts
```

### 5. Implement Electron Economy Service

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p src/domains/economy/services

# Create the electron service
# (Copy the content from the Electron Economy Service artifact)
nano src/domains/economy/services/ElectronService.ts
```

### 6. Create Puzzle Service

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p src/domains/puzzle/services

# Create the puzzle service
# (Copy the content from the Puzzle Service Implementation artifact)
nano src/domains/puzzle/services/PuzzleService.ts
```

## Setting Up UI Components

### 7. Build UI Context Providers

First, let's set up the context providers for state management:

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p src/ui/context

# Create the player context
# (This was included in the setup script)

# Create the game context
# (Copy the content from the Game Context Implementation artifact)
nano src/ui/context/GameContext.tsx
```

### 8. Implement Core UI Components

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p src/ui/components
mkdir -p src/ui/components/games

# Create the periodic table component
# (Copy the content from the Interactive Periodic Table Component artifact)
nano src/ui/components/PeriodicTableDisplay.tsx

# Create the progress bars modal
# (Copy the content from the Progress Bars Modal Component artifact)
nano src/ui/components/ProgressBarsModal.tsx

# Create the layout component
# (Copy the content from the Layout Component artifact)
nano src/ui/components/Layout.tsx

# Create a game component
# (Copy the content from the Element Match Game Component artifact)
nano src/ui/components/games/ElementMatchGame.tsx

# Create a placeholder for the tutorial game
touch src/ui/components/games/TutorialGame.tsx
```

For the TutorialGame.tsx, you can add a simple placeholder implementation:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { useGame } from '@/ui/context/GameContext';

const TutorialGame: React.FC = () => {
  const { exitToMenu } = useGame();

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-8">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Tutorial</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">This is a placeholder for the tutorial game.</p>
      <button onClick={exitToMenu} className="btn-primary">
        Back to Menu
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TutorialGame;
```

### 9. Create Pages

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p src/ui/pages

# Create the home page
# (Copy the content from the Home Page Component artifact)
nano src/ui/pages/HomePage.tsx

# Create the game page
# (Copy the content from the Game Page Component artifact)
nano src/ui/pages/GamePage.tsx

# Create the profile page
# (Copy the content from the Profile Page Component artifact)
nano src/ui/pages/ProfilePage.tsx

# Create a simple not found page
nano src/ui/pages/NotFoundPage.tsx
```

For the NotFoundPage.tsx, add:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const NotFoundPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-8">
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Page Not Found</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">The page you're looking for doesn't exist.</p>
      <Link to="/" className="btn-primary">
        Return to Home
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
};

export default NotFoundPage;
```

### 10. Set Up the Main App Component

```bash
# Update the App.tsx file
# (Copy the content from the Main App Structure artifact)
nano src/App.tsx
```

## Running the Application

Now you're ready to start the application:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:5173 and you should see the Isotope application running!

## Next Steps

Now that you have the basic application structure in place, you can focus on:

1. **Implementing the tutorial game**: Complete the TutorialGame component to teach players how to use the application
2. **Testing the progression system**: Ensure that players can advance through elements
3. **Adding more game modes**: Implement additional puzzle types
4. **Enhancing the UI**: Add animations, transitions, and polish

Refer to the "Isotope Development Todo List" for a complete list of tasks and follow the "Development Guidelines" to maintain a consistent approach throughout your development process.

Happy coding!
