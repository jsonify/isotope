## Tips for Staying on Track

1. **Focus on one task at a time** - Complete it fully before moving on
2. **Keep the project memory updated** - Add any new decisions or changes
3. **Commit regularly** - After completing each task or subtask
4. **Test continuously** - Write tests before implementation when possible
5. **Weekly review** - Check progress against the plan and adjust if needed
6. **Build vertically** - Get one feature working completely rather than doing partial work on multiple features

## Overcoming Common Challenges

- **Scope creep**: If you think of a new feature, add it to a "Future Ideas" section in your project memory rather than implementing it immediately
- **Technical roadblocks**: If stuck, simplify the approach rather than abandoning it
- **Motivation dips**: Focus on completing small, achievable tasks to maintain momentum
- **Perfectionism**: Remember that you can refine features in later iterations

## Daily Workflow

1. Review your todo list and project memory
2. Select the most important task
3. Break it into smaller subtasks if needed
4. Complete the task with tests
5. Update todo list and project memory
6. Commit your changes
7. Select the next task or end the session

By following this structured approach and focusing on one domain at a time, you'll make consistent progress and avoid getting sidetracked by new ideas.
