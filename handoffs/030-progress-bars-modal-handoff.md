## Summary of Current Work

In this session, we implemented the `ProgressBarsModal` component. This component displays a modal with progress bars for AN, AW, and GL progression metrics. We followed a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, first creating tests for the component and then implementing the component to pass the tests.

Key features of the `ProgressBarsModal` component include:

- Displays progress bars for Atomic Number (AN), Atomic Weight (AW), and Game Lab (GL) metrics.
- Uses Radix UI Dialog for modal functionality.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for consistency.
- Includes a close button for easy dismissal.
- Accessible design with appropriate ARIA attributes.
- Comprehensive test suite to ensure functionality and robustness.
