# Handoff Document: 027-current-work-handoff.md

## Summary of Current Work

In this session, we focused on debugging and fixing the Button component tests.

The main issues we addressed were:

- **Jest Mock Function Error:** Resolved the `jest.fn is not a function` error by importing `vi` from `vitest` and using `vi.fn()` instead of `jest.fn()` in the test file.
- **Tailwind CSS Class Assertion Failures:** Debugged and identified that the `toHaveClass` matcher was not working as expected. We switched to using `toContain` to check for class presence in the `className` string.
- **Incorrect Variant Name in Test:** Corrected the test to use `variant="default"` instead of `variant="primary"` to match the Button component's `buttonVariants` configuration.
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** While debugging, we ensured that Tailwind CSS and PostCSS are correctly configured for Vitest by adding `postcss.config.js` and installing necessary dependencies.

After these fixes, all 9 tests for the Button component are now passing.

## Next Steps

- Continue with the implementation plan and start implementing the `ThemeProvider` component using TDD.
- Create test file `src/ui/components/__tests__/ThemeProvider.test.tsx`.
- Copy `theme-provider.tsx` from `ui-prototype/components` to `src/ui/components/ThemeProvider.tsx`.
- Write test cases for ThemeProvider component and implement the component to pass tests.

## Files Modified

- `src/ui/components/__tests__/Button.test.tsx` (modified test assertions and imported `vi` from vitest, then removed import and replaced jest.fn with vi.fn)
- `src/ui/components/Button.tsx` (added debug logs, then removed logs)
- `postcss.config.js` (created)

## Handoff Complete

This document summarizes the debugging and fixes applied to the Button component and provides clear next steps for implementing the ThemeProvider component in the next session.
