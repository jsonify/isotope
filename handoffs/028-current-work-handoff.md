## Summary of Current Work

In this session, we focused on implementing UI components, specifically the `ThemeProvider` and `PeriodicTable` components, as part of the "Essential UI Components" section in `todo-list-phase-2.md`.

- **ThemeProvider Component:** We copied the `ThemeProvider` component from the `ui-prototype` and created a basic test file. However, we encountered issues with testing the `ThemeProvider` component, specifically related to `window.matchMedia` in the test environment. We tried various approaches to mock the browser environment, but the tests are still failing with "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'matches')". Due to these persistent issues, we decided to temporarily skip testing the `ThemeProvider` component and move on to the next component.

- **PeriodicTable Component:** We copied the `mini-periodic-table.tsx` component from `ui-prototype` and created a test file `PeriodicTable.test.tsx`. We implemented basic test cases for rendering the grid structure and displaying element data (symbol and name), which are currently passing. We also started implementing test cases for state-based styling, but these tests are failing, indicating issues with style application in the component. We fixed syntax errors that arose during the implementation process.

## Next Steps

- Continue working on the `PeriodicTable` component implementation and tests.
  - Debug and fix the state-based styling issues in `PeriodicTable` component.
  - Implement and test interactivity for `PeriodicTable` component (links and buttons).
  - Implement and test legend rendering for `PeriodicTable` component.
- Revisit `ThemeProvider` testing later, potentially exploring alternative testing strategies or environments.

## Files Modified

- `src/ui/components/ThemeProvider.tsx` (copied from ui-prototype)
- `src/ui/components/__tests__/ThemeProvider.test.tsx` (created, tests failing)
- `src/ui/components/PeriodicTable.tsx` (copied from ui-prototype, modified, tests partially passing)
- `src/ui/components/__tests__/PeriodicTable.test.tsx` (created, tests partially failing)
- `tsconfig.json` (modified to add path aliases)
- `src/tests/setup.ts` (modified to add browser mocks, then reverted)
