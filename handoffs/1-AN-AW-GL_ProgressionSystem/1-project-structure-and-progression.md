# Handoff 1: Project Structure and Progression Service Development

## Current Context

- Working on player progression service implementation and testing
- Game constants and domain models integration
- Installer system setup

## Active Files

- `src/domains/player/services/ProgressionService.ts`
- `src/domains/player/services/__tests__/progression-service/period-progress.test.ts`
- `src/domains/player/services/__tests__/progression-service/setup.ts`
- `src/domains/shared/constants/game-constants.ts`
- `src/domains/shared/models/domain-models.ts`
- `fixed-installer.js`
- `handoff-manager-installer.cjs`

## Project Structure

The project follows a domain-driven design architecture with the following domains:

- Player: Handles player-related functionality and progression
- Puzzle: Manages puzzle game mechanics
- Economy: Handles in-game economy systems
- Shared: Contains common utilities, models, and constants

## Current Development Focus

1. Progression Service

   - Implementing period-based progression tracking
   - Setting up test infrastructure for progression features
   - Integration with game constants and domain models

2. Installation System
   - Development of fixed installer script
   - Handoff manager installation configuration

## Next Steps

1. Complete progression service implementation and testing
2. Review and finalize game constants integration
3. Validate domain model implementations

## Notes

- Test setup files are being configured for progression service
- Multiple domains are interconnected through shared models and constants
- Installation system requires careful testing and validation
