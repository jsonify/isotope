# AW (Atomic Weight) Tracking Implementation Completion

## Executive Summary

The Atomic Weight (AW) tracking system has been successfully implemented as part of the AN-AW-GL progression system. This milestone completes the second component of our three-part progression tracking, managing how players accumulate points through puzzle completion and advance through elements.

### Key Achievements

- Implemented point calculation system with game mode-specific base points
- Created additive bonus system for achievements and streaks
- Integrated with AN tracking for element advancement
- Added comprehensive test coverage

### Dependencies

- Requires AN tracking system (completed)
- Relies on TransitionService for state changes
- Uses shared game constants for progression thresholds
- Integrates with PlayerProfileService for state management

## Implementation Overview

The Atomic Weight (AW) tracking system handles puzzle completion tracking and point calculations for player advancement.

### Core Components

1. **AtomicWeightService**

   - Handles point calculations for puzzle completion
   - Manages bonus point systems
   - Implements difficulty scaling

   ```typescript
   export class AtomicWeightService {
     public calculatePuzzlePoints(
       puzzle: Puzzle,
       result: PuzzleResult,
       currentAtomicNumber: number
     ): number;
     public calculateBonusPoints(
       basePoints: number,
       conditions: {
         isFirstCompletion?: boolean;
         isFlawlessStreak?: boolean;
         streakLength?: number;
       }
     ): number;
   }
   ```

2. **ProgressionService Integration**
   - Manages AW state in PlayerProfile
   - Handles element advancement based on AW thresholds
   - Tracks period progress and game mode unlocks

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Point Calculation System

- Base points vary by game mode difficulty
- Additive bonus system for multiple conditions
- Minimum point guarantees per game mode

```typescript
private readonly gameBasePoints: Record<GameMode, number> = {
  [GameMode.TUTORIAL]: 1,
  [GameMode.ELEMENT_MATCH]: 2,
  // ... scaling up to most complex modes
  [GameMode.ISOTOPE_BUILDER]: 5,
};
```

### 2. Bonus System Design

- Changed from multiplicative to additive bonuses
- Supports first completion and streak bonuses
- Caps maximum bonus percentages

```typescript
// Add bonuses additively
let totalBonusPercentage = 0;
if (conditions.isFirstCompletion) totalBonusPercentage += 0.25;
if (conditions.isFlawlessStreak) {
  totalBonusPercentage += Math.min(streakLength * 0.1, 0.5);
}
```

### 3. Progression Integration

- Tight integration with AN tracking
- Reset mechanics for element advancement
- Period-based game mode unlocking

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **Bonus Calculation Accuracy**

   - Challenge: Multiplicative bonuses causing unexpected results
   - Solution: Implemented additive bonus system with clear order of operations
   - Impact: More predictable and fair point awards

2. **Progress Tracking**

   - Challenge: Complex state management across game modes
   - Solution: Centralized tracking in ProgressionService
   - Impact: Consistent progression tracking and transitions

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Challenge: Multiple recalculations of progress
   - Solution: Cached intermediate results and minimized recomputation
   - Impact: Improved performance for frequent updates

## Test Coverage

### 1. Unit Tests

```typescript
describe('AtomicWeightService', () => {
  describe('calculatePuzzlePoints', () => {
    it('should calculate base points correctly');
    it('should apply difficulty scaling');
    it('should handle perfect solve bonuses');
  });

  describe('calculateBonusPoints', () => {
    it('should combine multiple bonus conditions');
    it('should cap maximum bonuses');
  });
});
```

### 2. Integration Tests

- Full progression cycle testing
- Multi-game mode interaction tests
- Period advancement scenarios
- Edge case handling

## Next Steps: GL (Game Lab) Implementation

### 1. Requirements

- Track game mode unlocks per period
- Handle transition animations
- Manage progression state

### 2. Integration Points

- Build on existing AN-AW system
- Utilize period tracking from AW implementation
- Extend ProgressionService capabilities

### 3. Key Considerations

- Game mode difficulty progression
- Period-based unlocking system
- Tutorial integration

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

1. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Cache frequently accessed progression data
   - Optimize period calculations
   - Reduce redundant profile updates

2. **State Management**

   - Consider implementing observer pattern for progress updates
   - Add progress event system
   - Improve transition handling

3. **Testing Improvements**
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Expand edge case coverage
   - Add stress testing for progression system

## Files Modified

1. Core Implementation:

   - `src/domains/player/services/AtomicWeightService.ts`
   - `src/domains/player/services/ProgressionService.ts`

2. Tests:

   - `src/domains/player/services/__tests__/AtomicWeightService.test.ts`
