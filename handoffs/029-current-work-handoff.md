## Summary of Current Work

In this session, we focused on enhancing the `PeriodicTable` component to function as a progression visualization and creating a demo to showcase it.

- **PeriodicTable Component Enhancements:**

  - **State-based Styling Debugging:** Debugged and fixed state-based styling issues, ensuring correct visual representation for 'completed', 'current', 'locked', and 'upcoming' states.
  - **Test Suite Enhancement:** Significantly enhanced the test suite to achieve comprehensive coverage, including state styling, interactivity, and accessibility. All 11 tests are now passing.
  - **Tooltip Implementation:** Integrated Radix UI Tooltip to display detailed element information on hover, including progress and unlock requirements.
  - **Accessibility Improvements:** Added ARIA labels and roles to improve component accessibility for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
  - **Progress Visualization:** Implemented progress bars for 'current' elements to visually represent progression status.

- **Demo Page Creation:**
  - Created `PeriodicTableDemo` component to showcase the `PeriodicTable` with various states, interactive features, and visual enhancements.
  - Added sample data in `periodic-table-data.ts` to populate the demo.
  - Updated `App.tsx` to render the `PeriodicTableDemo` for easy viewing.

## Next Steps

- Integrate the `PeriodicTableDisplay` component with the actual AN/AW/GL progression system to dynamically reflect player progression.
- Implement the `ProgressBarsModal` component to show detailed AN/AW/GL progress.
- Create the `GameModeSelection` interface to allow game mode selection.
- Build the simple profile display to show player profile information.
