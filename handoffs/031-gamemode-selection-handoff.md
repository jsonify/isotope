**Date:** 2025-03-22
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Complete

## Task Description

This document summarizes the completion of the "Create GameModeSelection interface" task as outlined in `todo-list-phase-2.md`. This task involved implementing a React component to display and handle the selection of different game modes in the Isotope game.

## Files Involved

- `src/ui/components/GameModeSelection.tsx`: Implementation of the GameModeSelection React component.
- `src/ui/components/__tests__/GameModeSelection.test.tsx`: Test suite for the GameModeSelection component, ensuring functionality and robustness.

## Implementation Summary

The `GameModeSelection` component was implemented with the following features:

- **Display of Game Modes:** Dynamically renders a list of game modes passed as props.
- **Game Mode Details:** Shows the name and description for each game mode.
- **Selection Handling:** Implements an `onSelect` prop to handle game mode selection, triggering the provided callback with the selected mode ID.
- **Disabled States:** Visually and functionally disables game modes marked as `disabled`, preventing selection and providing clear user feedback.
- **Responsive Layout:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS grid for a responsive layout across different screen sizes.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes a robust test suite covering rendering, interaction, and state management, ensuring component reliability.

## Verification Steps

- **Code Review:** The code in `GameModeSelection.tsx` and `GameModeSelection.test.tsx` has been reviewed and confirmed to meet the requirements of the task.
- **Test Execution:** All tests in `GameModeSelection.test.tsx` pass, validating the component's functionality.
- **Manual Verification:** The component was manually verified in the application to ensure it renders correctly and behaves as expected in the UI.

## Next Steps

- Integrate the `GameModeSelection` component into the game flow.
- Connect the component to the game state to dynamically fetch and display available game modes.
- Implement the actual game mode logic for the "Element Match" game mode, as outlined in `todo-list-phase-2.md`.
