   - Leverage GameModeSelection for game access
   - Connect with progression system for AW rewards

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - Create new game component in src/ui/components
   - Implement scoring calculation service
   - Add new test suite for game mechanics
   - Update existing integration tests

## Technical Dependencies

- AN/AW/GL progression system
- Player profile management
- Game mode selection interface
- Progress visualization components

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed technical design for Element Match game
2. Implement basic game mechanics and UI
