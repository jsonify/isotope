# Electron Service Architecture Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a simplified ElectronService using a functional module approach to maintain KISS and DRY principles. This implementation provides basic electron balance management functionality while avoiding over-engineering.

## Implementation Details

### Approach

Chose a functional module approach over a class-based service for several reasons:

- Simpler to implement and understand
- Reduces boilerplate code
- More direct encapsulation of logic
- Easier to test and maintain
- Aligns with KISS principle for initial implementation

### Core Components

1. **In-Memory Storage**

   - Uses TypeScript `Map<string, number>` for player balances
   - Simple and efficient key-value storage
   - Automatically handles player isolation

2. **Core Functions**
   ```typescript
   function getElectronBalance(playerId: string): number;
   function addElectrons(playerId: string, amount: number): boolean;
   function removeElectrons(playerId: string, amount: number): boolean;
   function initializePlayerBalance(playerId: string, initialBalance?: number): void;
   function calculatePuzzleReward(isPerfect: boolean, difficulty: DifficultyLevel): RewardResult;
   ```

### Key Features

1. **Type Safety**

   - Full TypeScript implementation
   - Strict parameter typing
   - Clear return types
   - Enum-like constant types for difficulty levels

2. **Error Handling**

   - Validation for negative amounts
   - Balance sufficiency checks
   - Safe default values
   - Fallback difficulty multipliers

3. **Data Isolation**
   - Separate balances per player
   - Private module-level storage
   - No shared state between players

### Reward Calculation System

1. **Configuration Constants**

   ```typescript
   const BASE_REWARD = 10;
   const DIFFICULTY_MULTIPLIERS = {
     EASY: 1,
     MEDIUM: 1.5,
     HARD: 2,
   };
   const PERFECT_SOLVE_MULTIPLIER = 1.2;
   ```

2. **Reward Formula**

   ```typescript
   totalReward =
     BASE_REWARD * DIFFICULTY_MULTIPLIERS[difficulty] * (isPerfect ? PERFECT_SOLVE_MULTIPLIER : 1);
   ```

3. **Key Design Decisions**
   - Simple multiplier-based system for easy scaling
   - Configurable constants for easy tuning
   - Clear separation of base rewards and modifiers
   - Type-safe difficulty levels

## Testing Implementation

Created comprehensive test suite covering:

- Basic balance operations
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Player balance isolation
- Multiple operation sequences
- Reward calculations for all difficulty levels
- Perfect/non-perfect solve combinations

### Test Categories

1. **Balance Retrieval**

   - New player defaults
   - Initialized balances

2. **Balance Modifications**

   - Adding electrons
   - Removing electrons
   - Multiple operations

3. **Validation Tests**

   - Negative amounts
   - Insufficient balance
   - Invalid operations

4. **Player Isolation**

   - Multiple player interactions
   - Balance independence

5. **Reward Calculation Tests**
   - Base reward verification
   - Difficulty scaling
   - Perfect solve multipliers
   - Combined multiplier effects

## Technical Decisions

1. **Storage Choice**

   - Chose `Map` for efficient key-value storage
   - In-memory for initial implementation
   - Can be extended for persistence later

2. **Function Signatures**

   - Boolean returns for operation success/failure
   - Optional parameters with safe defaults
   - Consistent parameter ordering
   - Type-safe difficulty levels

3. **Error Handling**

   - Silent failures with boolean returns
   - No exceptions for business logic
   - Clear validation rules

4. **Reward System**
   - Multiplier-based for simplicity and flexibility
   - Configurable constants for easy balancing
   - Type-safe difficulty levels
   - Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Enhancements**

   - Add persistence layer
   - Implement transaction history
   - Add event notifications
   - Add time-based bonuses
   - Implement combo rewards

2. **Integration**
   - Connect with PlayerProfile
   - Add to game reward system
   - Implement UI components
   - Add visual feedback for rewards
