# Handoff Document: Current Work - Electron Balance Tracking and Transaction History

**Handoff Number:** 023
**Date:** March 18, 2025

**1. Project Goal:**
Continue implementing electron balance tracking and transaction history features.

**2. Current Status:**

- Electron balance tracking MVP is implemented (Handoff 021).
- Electron transaction history implementation is in progress (Handoff 022).
- Tests for ElectronService are being updated and refactored.

**3. Key Technical Decisions:**

- Use local storage for electron balance and transaction history persistence.
- Implement ElectronService to manage electron balance and transactions.
- Define clear data models for ElectronBalance and ElectronTransaction.

**4. Conversation Extraction Insights:**

- The conversation focused on debugging failing tests in `src/tests/ElectronService.test.ts`, specifically related to transaction history recording.
- The root cause was identified as lack of test isolation and incorrect test expectations regarding transaction counts due to initialization processes in `beforeEach` hooks.
- The solution involved ensuring test isolation by clearing service data at the start of each test, making test setup explicit with balance initialization, and updating test expectations to match actual transaction recording behavior.
- As a result, all 23 tests in `ElectronService.test.ts` are now passing.

**5. Next Steps:**

- Complete implementation of Electron transaction history.
- Implement UI to display transaction history.
- Integrate transaction history with electron balance tracking.
- Write integration tests for transaction history functionality.

**6. Lessons Learned:**

- [Document any lessons learned during the implementation process.]

**7. Open Issues and Questions:**

- [List any open issues or questions that need to be addressed.]

**8. Additional Notes:**

- [Include any other relevant information or context.]
