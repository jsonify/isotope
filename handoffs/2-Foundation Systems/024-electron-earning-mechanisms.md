# Micro-Handoff: Electron Earning Mechanisms Implementation

**Date:** March 18, 2025
**Previous Handoff:** 023-current-work-handoff.md

## Implementation Summary

Added basic electron earning functionality to ElectronService with the following features:

1. New `earn` method:

   - Validates and processes electron earnings
   - Records transactions with specific 'earn' type
   - Maintains accurate balance updates

2. Transaction Types:

   - Added 'earn' as a new transaction type alongside existing 'add', 'remove', and 'initialize'
   - Distinguishes earning events from manual balance adjustments

3. Test Coverage:
   - Added comprehensive test suite
   - All 27 tests passing
   - Includes validation, balance updates, and transaction history verification

## Technical Details

1. Interface Updates:

```typescript
interface ElectronTransaction {
  timestamp: Date;
  type: 'add' | 'remove' | 'initialize' | 'earn';
  amount: number;
  previousBalance: number;
  newBalance: number;
}
```

2. New Function:

```typescript
export function earn(playerId: string, amount: number): boolean {
  if (amount <= 0) {
    return false;
  }
  const previousBalance = getElectronBalance(playerId);
  const newBalance = previousBalance + amount;
  electronBalances.set(playerId, newBalance);
  recordTransaction(playerId, {
    timestamp: new Date(),
    type: 'earn',
    amount,
    previousBalance,
    newBalance,
  });
  return true;
}
```

## Testing

- Added test suite for `earn` method
- Tests verify:
  - Balance updates work correctly
  - Transaction history is recorded properly
  - Negative amounts are rejected
  - Multiple earnings accumulate correctly
- All tests passing (27 total)

## Next Steps

1. Connect earning events to specific game actions
2. Implement reward distribution logic
3. Add UI elements to display earning events
