# Handoff Document: Electron Transaction History Test Fix

**Date:** 2025-03-18

**Author:** Roo (Handoff Manager)

**Status:** Completed

## Objective

The objective of this handoff was to resolve the failing tests in `src/tests/ElectronService.test.ts` related to transaction history. The tests were failing because transaction histories were accumulating across test runs, leading to incorrect assertion counts.

## Work Done

The following steps were taken to address the issue:

1. **Analysis:**

   - Analyzed the test failures and identified that transaction histories were not being properly cleared between test runs.
   - Hypothesized that the `initializePlayerBalance` calls in the global `beforeEach` hook were creating unintended initialization transactions, leading to extra transactions in subsequent tests.

2. **Code Changes:**

   - **Created `initializePlayerBalanceForTesting`:** Added a new exported function `initializePlayerBalanceForTesting` in `src/domains/economy/services/ElectronService.ts` that initializes player balances without recording transactions. This function is intended for testing purposes.
   - **Updated `beforeEach` in `ElectronService.test.ts`:** Modified the `beforeEach` hook in `src/tests/ElectronService.test.ts` to use `initializePlayerBalanceForTesting` instead of `initializePlayerBalance`. This prevents the creation of initialization transactions during test setup.
   - **Added Debug Logging:** Added console logs in `clearAllElectronServiceData`, `initializePlayerBalance`, and `recordTransaction` in `src/domains/economy/services/ElectronService.ts` to help debug and trace the state changes during test execution.
   - **Created `ElectronTransactionHistory.test.ts`:** Created a new test file `src/tests/ElectronTransactionHistory.test.ts` to isolate and verify the transaction history logic independently, without balance initialization in the `beforeEach` hook.

3. **Testing and Verification:**
   - **Verified `ElectronTransactionHistory.test.ts` Pass:** Confirmed that the isolated transaction history tests in `src/tests/ElectronTransactionHistory.test.ts` passed, validating the core transaction recording logic.
   - **Verified `ElectronService.test.ts` Pass:** After updating the `beforeEach` hook in `src/tests/ElectronService.test.ts` to use `initializePlayerBalanceForTesting`, re-ran all tests in `src/tests/ElectronService.test.ts` and confirmed that all 23 tests now pass.

## Conclusion

The test failures were resolved by preventing unintended transaction recording during test setup. The new `initializePlayerBalanceForTesting` function provides a way to initialize player balances in tests without affecting transaction history, ensuring accurate test assertions.

The changes ensure that tests are isolated and transaction histories are correctly managed, leading to more reliable and accurate test results.

## Next Steps

- Remove debug logging from `ElectronService.ts` now that the issue is resolved.
- Consider adding integration tests to verify the transaction history functionality in a broader context.
- Review and merge the changes to the codebase.

**File Changes:**

- `src/domains/economy/services/ElectronService.ts`
  - Added `initializePlayerBalanceForTesting` function.
  - Added debug logging (to be removed in next steps).
- `src/tests/ElectronService.test.ts`
  - Updated `beforeEach` to use `initializePlayerBalanceForTesting`.
  - Updated imports to include `initializePlayerBalanceForTesting`.
- `src/tests/ElectronTransactionHistory.test.ts`
  - Created new test file to isolate transaction history tests.

**Terminal Output:**

```
Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  23 passed (23)
   Start at  10:04:51
   Duration  1.19s
