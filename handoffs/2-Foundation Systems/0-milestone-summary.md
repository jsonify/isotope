# Milestone Summary: Foundation Systems

**Milestone Name:** Foundation Systems

**Date:** March 18, 2025

**Summary:**
This milestone marks the completion of the foundational systems for the application. It includes the implementation of core components such as player profile management, economy system, puzzle service, and shared domain services. These systems provide the base functionality for the application and set the stage for future feature development.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Implemented Core Domains:** Successfully implemented the core domains of the application:
  - `economy`: Manages in-game currency and transactions.
  - `player`: Handles player profile creation, loading, saving, and management.
  - `puzzle`: Provides puzzle logic and puzzle data.
  - `shared`: Contains shared constants, models, and services used across domains.
- **Robust Save/Load Functionality:** Implemented a robust save/load system for player profiles using local storage, including:
  - Data serialization and deserialization with versioning.
  - Data validation to ensure data integrity.
  - Error handling for storage availability and quota issues.
  - Auto-save functionality to prevent data loss.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy:** Developed and implemented a comprehensive error handling strategy, including:
  - Centralized logging with structured metadata.
  - Error handling layers (validation, operation, storage).
  - Recovery mechanisms for data corruption and schema mismatches.
- **Unit and Integration Testing:** Established a solid testing foundation with unit and integration tests covering core functionalities, error handling, and data integrity.

## Core Architecture Decisions

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** We adopted a Domain-Driven Design approach to structure the codebase, reflected in the `src/domains` directory. This improves code organization, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) within Domains:** Implemented SOA within each domain, encapsulating business logic in services to promote modularity and testability.
- **Local Storage for Persistence:** Chose local storage for player profile persistence due to its simplicity and suitability for the current data volume.
- **JSON Serialization with Versioning:** Implemented JSON serialization for player profiles with schema versioning to handle data evolution and migrations.
- **Validation Service:** Created a dedicated `ValidationService` with the singleton pattern to centralize and enforce data validation rules.
- **Centralized Logging with `LogService`:** Adopted a centralized `LogService` for consistent and structured logging across the application.

## Lessons Learned

- **Start Simple, Iterate and Enhance:** Starting with simplified implementations and iteratively enhancing them is an effective approach to manage complexity and accelerate development.
- **Importance of Planning and Documentation:** Thorough planning and documentation (handoff documents) are crucial for communication, design clarity, and implementation guidance.
- **Focus on Core Functionality First:** Prioritizing core functionality allows for early validation and provides a solid foundation for future feature development.
- **Testing is Integral, Not an Afterthought:** Testing should be an integral part of the development process, with comprehensive unit, integration, and error scenario tests.
- **Error Handling is Crucial for Robustness:** Robust error handling is essential for building reliable applications, especially when dealing with data persistence.
- **Type Safety and Validation are Key for Data Integrity:** Type safety (TypeScript) and validation layers are critical for maintaining data integrity and preventing data corruption.
- **Separation of Concerns Improves Maintainability:** Separating concerns (serialization, storage, validation, logging) leads to more modular, maintainable, and testable code.

## Technical Challenges

- **Serialization Complexity:** Implementing efficient and reliable serialization for complex game state objects required careful consideration of performance and data integrity.
- **Local Storage Limitations:** Working with local storage introduced limitations in storage capacity and error handling (quota exceeded errors).
- **Data Validation and Versioning:** Implementing robust data validation and schema versioning added complexity to the save/load system.
- **Ensuring Data Integrity:** Maintaining data integrity across save/load cycles, especially with potential storage errors and data corruption, was a significant technical challenge.
