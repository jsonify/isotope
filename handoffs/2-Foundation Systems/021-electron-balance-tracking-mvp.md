# Micro-Handoff: 021 - Electron Balance Tracking (Minimum Viable Product)

## Context: Add electron balance tracking with minimum viable functionality

This micro-handoff documents the completion of the minimum viable product for electron balance tracking within the `ElectronService`. This addresses the initial requirement to "Add electron balance tracking" as outlined in the user feedback.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Create balance management functions
- [x] Add validation and constraints
- [x] üìù Create new micro-handoff with tracking implementation (This document)

### Implementation Summary:

The `ElectronService` now includes basic in-memory electron balance tracking functionality. This implementation is considered a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and provides the foundational features for managing player electron balances.

**Key Features Implemented:**

1.  **Balance Management Functions:**

    - `getElectronBalance(playerId: string)`: Retrieves the current electron balance for a player.
    - `addElectrons(playerId: string, amount: number)`: Adds electrons to a player's balance with validation to ensure amounts are positive.
    - `removeElectrons(playerId: string, amount: number)`: Removes electrons from a player's balance with validation to ensure amounts are positive and sufficient balance exists.
    - `initializePlayerBalance(playerId: string, initialBalance?: number)`: Initializes or resets a player's electron balance, defaulting to 0 and preventing negative initial balances.

2.  **Validation and Constraints:**

    - `addElectrons` and `removeElectrons` functions include basic validation to reject negative amounts.
    - `removeElectrons` prevents balance from going below zero.
    - `initializePlayerBalance` ensures initial balance is not negative.

3.  **In-Memory Storage:**
    - Electron balances are currently stored in-memory using a `Map`. This is suitable for MVP but persistence will be required for production.

### Considerations for Future Development:

- **Persistence:** The current implementation uses in-memory storage, which is not persistent. Future development will need to address data persistence (e.g., using local storage, databases, or server-side storage).
- **Transaction History:** No transaction history is currently implemented. This is a potential future feature for tracking electron gains and losses.
- **Error Handling:** Basic validation is in place, but more comprehensive error handling and logging might be needed for production.
- **Concurrency:** The current in-memory `Map` might need to be revisited if concurrency becomes a major concern in the future.

### Conclusion:

The minimum viable product for electron balance tracking is now implemented within `ElectronService`. This provides the necessary foundation for managing player electrons. Further enhancements, such as persistence and transaction history, can be addressed in subsequent development cycles.

This handoff document serves as confirmation that the basic electron balance tracking functionality is complete and ready for integration and further development.
