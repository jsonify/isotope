# Micro-Handoff: Electron Progression Rewards Integration

**Date:** March 18, 2025
**Previous Handoff:** 024-electron-earning-mechanisms.md

## Implementation Summary

Connected electron rewards to puzzle completion with the following features:

1. Direct integration with existing puzzle completion flow
2. Proper transaction typing using 'earn' instead of 'add'
3. Full test coverage for puzzle reward scenarios

## Technical Details

1. Modified `awardElectrons` in ElectronService to use `earn`:

```typescript
export function awardElectrons(
  profile: PlayerProfile,
  electrons: number,
  source: ElectronSource,
  description: string
): { profile: PlayerProfile; rewardDetails?: RewardDetails } {
  if (electrons > 0) {
    earn(profile.id, electrons);
  }
  return {
    profile,
    rewardDetails: {
      electronsAwarded: electrons,
      source,
      description,
    },
  };
}
```

2. Reward Flow:
   - Puzzle completion triggers `calculatePuzzleReward`
   - Reward is applied through `awardElectrons`
   - Transaction is recorded with 'earn' type
   - Balance is updated automatically

## Testing

Added comprehensive test suite in `PuzzleCompletionRewards.test.ts`:

- Basic puzzle completion rewards
- Perfect completion bonuses
- Cumulative balance tracking
- Transaction history verification

All tests passing:

- 4 new integration tests
- 27 existing unit tests

## Integration Points

1. PuzzleService:

   - Calculates rewards based on performance
   - Uses difficulty levels and perfect solve status
   - Calls awardElectrons with correct source

2. ElectronService:
   - Records transactions with 'earn' type
   - Maintains accurate balances
   - Tracks transaction history

## Next Steps

1. Add UI elements to display earning events
2. Consider varying rewards based on:
   - Puzzle complexity
   - Game mode
   - Achievement streaks
