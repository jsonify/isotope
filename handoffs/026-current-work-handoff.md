## Summary of Current Work

In this session, we focused on resolving TypeScript errors in `src/tests/EconomyIntegration.test.ts` that arose after refactoring `ElectronService.ts`.

The main issues we addressed were:

- **Incorrect import paths:** We corrected import paths to ensure consistent type usage across modules.
- **`PlayerProfile` interface compatibility:** We updated the `createTestPlayerProfile` helper function in `EconomyIntegration.test.ts` to fully implement the `PlayerProfile` interface from `src/domains/shared/models/domain-models.ts`, including adding missing properties like `tutorialCompleted`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` and ensuring `Date` objects are used for date properties.
- **`ElementSymbol` usage:** We corrected the usage of `ElementSymbol` in `EconomyIntegration.test.ts` to use string literals directly (e.g., `'H'`) instead of `ElementSymbol.H`, as `ElementSymbol` is a type alias, not an enum.
- **`ElectronSource` type error:** We are still investigating a persistent TypeScript error related to `ElectronSource` in `EconomyIntegration.test.ts`, where the compiler incorrectly flags `ElectronSource.PUZZLE_COMPLETION` as not assignable to type `ElectronSource`. We have tried casting and namespace qualification, and will investigate further.

Despite the remaining `ElectronSource` error, we have made significant progress in cleaning up the TypeScript errors and ensuring the test suite is closer to a working state.

## Next Steps

- **Investigate and resolve the remaining `ElectronSource` TypeScript error** in `EconomyIntegration.test.ts`. This might involve further examination of import paths, potential circular dependencies, or even a deeper dive into the TypeScript compiler behavior.
- **Run the test suite** (`pnpm test src/tests/EconomyIntegration.test.ts`) to confirm that the integration tests are passing after resolving the TypeScript errors.
- **Continue with the original task** of [previous task description, if applicable, or state "continue improving electron service and related tests"].

## Files Modified

- `src/domains/economy/services/ElectronService.ts` (minor export change)
- `src/tests/EconomyIntegration.test.ts` (major updates to fix type errors and improve test setup)
