# PeriodicTable Component Debug Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the TDD-focused approach to debug and fix state-based styling issues in the PeriodicTable component, with emphasis on maintaining robust test coverage while following KISS and DRY principles.

## Current State Analysis

- Component implements state-based styling via `getElementStyles` helper function
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling consistency
- Test suite covers basic rendering, grid structure, and state-based styling
- State-based styling tests are partially failing

## Debugging Strategy

### 1. Test Isolation and Verification

- Run targeted tests for state-based styling
- Identify specific failing assertions in state tests
- Verify test environment setup for styling tests
- Document exact failure patterns

### 2. Debug Process (Using TDD)

1. **Isolate Failing Tests**

   - Focus on specific state styling tests
   - Create more granular test cases if needed
   - Document exact failure conditions

2. **Review Style Logic**

   - Validate `getElementStyles` function implementation
   - Verify state-to-style mappings
   - Check Tailwind class consistency

3. **Implementation Fixes**
   - Make minimal necessary changes
   - Follow TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor
   - Ensure no regression in passing tests

### 3. Tailwind Configuration Review

- Verify color definitions in config
- Check custom style extensions
- Validate class naming consistency

### 4. Test Enhancement

- Add boundary condition tests
- Verify style application in different states
- Test style transitions and combinations

## Implementation Plan

1. Run focused test suite
2. Document specific failures
3. Implement minimal fixes
4. Verify fixes with test suite
5. Run regression tests
6. Document any configuration changes

## Success Criteria

- All state-based styling tests pass
- No regression in existing functionality
- Maintainable and clear styling logic
- Consistent style application across states

## Confidence Level: 8/10

Rationale:

- Well-structured existing codebase
- Clear test coverage
- Predictable styling system (Tailwind)
- Targeted debugging approach
